# Travel-checklist

Travel Checklist was created for HS Hacks IV by [Rafael Cenzano](https://github.com/RafaelCenzano), [Cappillen Lee](https://github.com/Calee14), Wenna Lu, and Luna. This project was our first hackathon project and we used ClarifAI to do image recognition and json to store user data and cookies to store a users ID. Originally created October 2018.
